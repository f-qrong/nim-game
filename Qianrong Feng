"""
Start by placing counters (coins or toothpicks or something) into 3 piles.
Player #1 picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile. (It's okay to take the whole pile.)
Player #2 picks a pile, then removes one or more counters from that pile.
Player #1 plays again. (It's okay to choose a different pile this time.)
Whichever player is forced to take the last counter is the LOSER.
